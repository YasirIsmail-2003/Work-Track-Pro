# Supabase (public keys for client usage)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"

# Supabase server role (KEEP SECRET) - set as Environment Variable in Vercel (do NOT expose to client)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"

# Database (Postgres)
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@hostname:5432/dbname"

# Notes:
# - Mark server-only secrets as "Environment: Production" only if needed and do not use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for secrets.
# - Vercel allows "Environment Variables" configuration for Production, Preview and Development.
# - If you need build-time variables for Next.js, set them in Vercel as well (they will be available during build).
